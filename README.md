# Instructions
Using what you have learnt so far and any extra you have learnt on your own, look at what is there in main.py and improve it. Currently it is working, however, it is limited in its scope. I want you to improve it with these metrics in mind.

1. Replace any duplicate code with anything that could be done with a function
2. Replace any pure strings with actual data types, variables and values
3. Replace any hard coded in values with variable references
    1. This is similar to **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
4. There will be tests that require items and inputs that have not been covered in the code so far
    1. Provide a 5th option - Chocolate - $3.00
    2. Provide an 8th option - Tea - $2.00
    3. The options in between need to be filled too, but they are your choice
    4. The output should calculate the cost from the amount chosen by the customer

Don't worry about the total cost having the double `00` at the end of the cost like a money amount, we are using floats that will automatically limit to only one 0 after the decimal point.

## Hints
This is building on your knowledge of data types and conditional flow. Try it out a couple times yourself, but don't be worried about not looking online or reaching out to a team mate. If you get stuck, or the test is having issues, reach out to me after you have tried it fix it on your own. Example successful outputs are shown in the skeleton code, it needs to match what is in the console.

Remember, there is no **right** code, there is only working code. If you want to write better code, then focus on readability and sustainability, can someone else look at your code, read it and work on it without necessarily needing comments or a full documentation?
